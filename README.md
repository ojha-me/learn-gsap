# Learn GSAP 

I am using this repo to track my progress in learning GSAP. I am using React 19, TypeScript, and Vite for the development of this project.

Ideally I will be first learning how different features/concepts etc work in gsap. Each on its own page.
And once I feel like I am comfortable enough at using this I will create a full landing page using combining everything I have learned.
